    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup room temperature water</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li> 
        <li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dark chocolate chips</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cream together softened butter and sugars for several minutes until light and fluffy, scraping down the sides.</li>
        <li>Gradually add in water and vanilla extract and beat to combine. (The water will cause the mixture to appear curdled. Turn your mixer on medium-high and beat for a few more minutes to bring the ingredients back together.)</li>
        <li>To a mixing bowl, add dry ingredients including flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt.</li>
        <li>Stir in the chocolate chips and chill the cookie dough in the fridge for 30 minutes or more</li>
        <li>Use a cookie scoop or spoon to portion out the dough to 2" balls. Place on a parchment lined baking sheet and bake on the center rack at 350F until the edges are golden brown, for about 12 minutes. The cookie centers will look puffy and under-baked, but trust the process!</li>
        <li>Let the cookies cool to set. They will flatten out and continue cooking after they're removed from the oven. Wait until the cookies are set, 5 minutes or so, before transferring so they don't fall apart.</li>
    </ol>
